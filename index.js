//! Start by creating the variables for the data recorded
let day1TempF = 32
let day2TempC = 25
let day3TempF = 70
console.log(day1TempF)
//* Then work on the conversion of the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit (or viceversa)


//! Start the calculation of the total temperatures
//* Then apply the conversion to calculate the total in the other unit of measurement
//* Call the variables: tot_temperature_in_fahrenheit and tot_temperature_in_celsius

//! Start the calculation of the average temperatures
//* Call the variables: avg_temperature_in_fahrenheit and avg_temperature_in_celsius

//! Console.log the results for your own inspection if you'd like

//! After creating the four variables mentioned above, uncomment the following lines
//* This way you can export them to the test file, this is essential for the tests to work

module.exports = {
    // tot_temperature_in_fahrenheit,
    // tot_temperature_in_celsius,
    // avg_temperature_in_fahrenheit,
    // avg_temperature_in_celsius
